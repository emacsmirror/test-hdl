  ;; It is needed to explicitly fontify for batch-mode updates, since by
  ;; default batch mode does not enable font-lock.  Initially tried with
  ;; `font-lock-ensure' but gave different results for tree-sitter.  Plus,
  ;; `faceup-write-file' calls internally `font-lock-fontify-region' so
  ;; it's more consistent
  (font-lock-fontify-region (point-min) (point-max))
  ;; The code below is copied/adapted from `faceup-write-file':
  ;;  - The target is to replace the content of current buffer with its
  ;;  corresponding faceup format
  ;;  - `faceup-markup-to-buffer' first arg is the target buffer, which
  ;;  will be the original one
  ;;  - A temp buffer is used as temporary storage to place the data to
  ;;  be processed
  (let ((buffer-orig (current-buffer)))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-buffer-substring buffer-orig)
      (with-current-buffer buffer-orig
        (erase-buffer))
      (faceup-markup-to-buffer buffer-orig (current-buffer)))))
